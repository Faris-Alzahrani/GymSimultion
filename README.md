Enter 3 for Trainee history : check the history of each trainee (what machines he trained on)

Enter 4 for machine history : check the machine history to see who are the trainees who used it

Enter 5 to check how many were affected by waiting time : to see the number of trainees who waited more than 35 minutes

then the user keep on forwarding the time until the workig duration of the Gym (in hours) expires.
